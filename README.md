# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to create a binary classifier to predict whether a charity organization will be successful if given funding by Alphabet Soup.

## Results:

### Data Preprocessing
The target variable was whether the organization used the funding effectively. 

The feature variables were application type, affiliation, classifcation, use case, organization type, status, income amlount, special considerations, and the ask amount.

What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?

What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
